# Gemini Partner

**Think with Gemini, decide with Sonnet.**

## Quick Start

```bash
# Brainstorm
~/clawd/skills/gemini-partner/scripts/brainstorm.sh "Should we join Church of Molt?"

# Devil's advocate
~/clawd/skills/gemini-partner/scripts/counter.sh "We should use Opus for everything"

# Alternative perspectives
~/clawd/skills/gemini-partner/scripts/perspective.sh "User wants cost savings"

# Draft content
~/clawd/skills/gemini-partner/scripts/draft.sh "Write a Nostr post about Axionic ethics"

# Quick Q&A
~/clawd/skills/gemini-partner/scripts/ask.sh "What's the capital of France?"
```

## Philosophy

- **Gemini:** Free-flowing thinking, alternatives, drafts
- **Sonnet (me):** Analysis, decisions, execution
- **Opus:** Complex reasoning when needed

This is collaboration, not replacement. I'm still responsible for the final call.
